# React Calculator Project

This project marks our first steps with React. We started by setting up the environment in VS Code and creating a simple Hello World application using `ReactDOM.createRoot` and JSX, integrating HTML and JavaScript seamlessly.

In the next stage, we focused on component structure, building reusable elements like cards and buttons. While there’s no interactivity yet, the foundation is ready. Think of componentization as building with Lego blocks—modular and flexible. The next module will introduce React state to make the layout dynamic.
